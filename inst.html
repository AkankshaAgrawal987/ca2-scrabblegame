            <li>Enter both player's names and click "START" to begin!</li>
            <li>Place tiles on the board to spell out words.  Click on the letter on your rack and then click again on the location you'd like to place it.</li>
            <li>Except for the first turn, at least one of your letters must touch a letter already in play, and your new letters must all be in the same row or column, and be touching another tile.</li>
            <li>At the beginning of your turn, click "SHOW TILES" to reveal the letters on your rack.</li>
            <li>After you click "Submit" your score is tallied and your rack refreshed from the tile bag.</li>
            <li>Clicking "Refresh" will give you a brand new rack and shuffle your current tiles back into the bag.  Doing this forfeits your current turn.</li>
            <li>Clicking "Exit" will take you to the gameover page where you will see the winner of the game.</li>
            <li>To again start the game click on "Restart" which will show after the end of the game</li>
            <li>Clicking "Exit" will take you to the main page.</li>
